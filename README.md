## Minimum Vertex Cover Problem 
Given an undirected graph, the task is to find the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. This problem is NP-hard, meaning that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it. Minimum vertex cover problem is a theoretical model for various problems such as. a commercial establishment interested in installing the fewest possible closed circuit cameras covering all hallways (edges) connecting all rooms (nodes) on a floor. In this notebook, I attempt to solve the minimum vertex cover problem using dwave solver for Erdos Renyi graphs with different number of nodes (4-20) and compared the performace with brute-force method.
